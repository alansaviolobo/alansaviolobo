Dishwasher Repairman

This lady's dishwasher quit working, so she called a repairman. He couldn't accommodate her 
with an evening appointment, and since she had to go to work the next day, she told him: 
"I'll leave the key under the mat. Fix the dishwasher, leave the bill on the counter, and 
I'll mail you the check. By the way, don't worry about my Rottweiler.He won't bother you. 
But, whatever you do, not under *any* circumstances talk to my parrot!" When the repairman 
arrived at Mrs. Lonefold's apartment the next day, he discovered the biggest and meanest 
looking Rottweiler he had ever seen.But, just like she had said, the dog just lay there on 
the carpet, watching the repairman go about his business. However, the whole time he was 
there, the parrot drove him nuts with his incessant cursing, yelling, and name-calling. 
Finally the repairman couldn't contain himself any longer and yelled: 
"Shut up, you stupid ugly bird!!"
To which the parrot replied: "GET HIM, Brutus!!"
