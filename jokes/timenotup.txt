Your Time Is Not Up Yet!

A middle-aged woman had a heart attack and was taken
to the hospital. While on the operating table, she
had a near death experience.

Seeing God, she asked "Is my time up?"

God said, "No, you have another 43 years, 2 months,
and 8 days to live."

Upon recovery, the woman decided to stay in the
hospital and have a facelift, liposuction, and a
tummy tuck. She even had someone come in and change
her hair color. Since she had so much more time to
live, she figured she might as well make the most
of it.

After her last operation, she was released from the
hospital. While crossing the street on her way home,
she was killed by an ambulance.

Arriving in front of God, she demanded, "I thought
you said I had another 40 years? Why didn't you
pull me from out of the path of the ambulance?"

God replied, "I didn't recognize you!"
