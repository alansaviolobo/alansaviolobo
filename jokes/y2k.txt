RE: Changing Calendars from Y2K 
I hope that I haven't misunderstood your instructions because, to be honest, 
none of this Y to K problem made much sense to me. At any rate, I have finished the 
conversion of all of the months on all of the company calendars for next year.  
The calendars have returned from the printer and are ready to be distributed with 
the following new months: 


Januark
Februark
Mak
Julk

I also changed all the days of each week to: 

Sundak
Mondak
Tuesdak
Wednesdak
Thursdak
Fridak
Saturdak 
We are now Y to K compliant.  Have a nice dak!!!
