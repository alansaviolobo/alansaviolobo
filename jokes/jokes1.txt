Pedro is sitting in a bar sipping away his tequila when a hefty , bearded man enters the bar with a bang everybody makes way for him.He walks up to the bartender, and while touching his beard says "I am Castro's men! give me a beer!" The scared bartender promptly gives him a beer.He gulps it down in a second and he walks out of the bar satisfied.Pedro who is watching all this thinks "Wow! this is great service."

Another man just like the first enters the bar a few minutes later. He too has a beard and holding onto it he says" I am Castro's men!Give me a beer!" The scared bartender hands him the beer which he gulps down in a second.He walks out of the bar and the bar is back to normal again. Pedro says "This is great! I am going to try this out now!"

So Pedro goes to the bartender and shouts out "Hey you! Look at me when I talk to you!!!I am Casrto's men! Give me a beer now!"The bewildered bartender looks at him and says "Castro's men??? But where is your beard sir?" Pedro thinks for a minute ... pulls his pants down and says "I AM AN UNDERCOVER AGENT"

It so happened that one day in heaven, St Peter took a toilet break and told Jesus to stand at the entrance of the Pearly Gates.While Jesus was there, a bearded old man came up to the gates. Jesus asked him "And my man what good have you done on earth?"

The man replied "While I was on earth, I had a son who was loving, spread messages of love and did good to the whole world.And then I lost him" The old man at this point burst into tears.

Jesus with a joyous tear in his eye said, "Papa???"

The old man said, "Pinnochio???"
