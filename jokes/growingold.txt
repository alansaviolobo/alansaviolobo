GROWING OLD

An elderly man and woman were dating for a while. the man finally decided to ask her to marry 
him. she immediately said "yes".the next morning when he awoke, he couldn't remember what her 
answer was! "was she happy? i think so. No. she looked at me kinda funny.."
after about an hour of trying to remember to no avail, he got on the phone and gave her a call.
Embarrassed, he admitted that he didn't remember her answer to the marriage proposal.
"oh", she said, I'm so glad you called. I remembered saying 'yes' to someone, but i couldn't 
remember who it was."
