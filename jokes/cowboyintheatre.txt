The cowboy lay sprawled across three entire seats in the posh Amarillo 
theatre. When the usher came by and noticed this he whispered to the 
cowboy, "Sorry, sir, but you're only allowed one seat." The cowboy 
groaned but didn't budge. The usher became more impatient. "Sir, if 
you don't get up from there, I'm going to have to call the manager. 
The cowboy just groaned. 

The usher marched briskly back up the aisle. In a moment he returned
with the manager. Together the two of them tried repeatedly to move 
the cowboy, but with no success. Finally, they summoned the police. 
The cop surveyed the situation briefly then asked, "All right buddy, 
what's you're name?" 

"Sam," the cowboy moaned. 

"Where ya from, Sam?" 

With pain in his voice Sam replied.... "The balcony."
