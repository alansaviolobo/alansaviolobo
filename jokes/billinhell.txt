BILL GATES IN HELL
Satan greets him: "Welcome Mr. Gates, we've been waiting for you. This will be your home for all
 eternity. You've been selfish, greedy and a big liar all your life. Now, since you've got me in
 a good mood, I'll be generous and give you a choice of three places in which you'll be locked 
up forever.

Satan takes Bill to a huge lake of fire in which millions of poor souls are tormented and 
tortured. He then takes him to a massive coliseum where thousands of people are chased about and
 devoured by starving lions. Finally, he takes Bill to a tiny room in which there is a bottle of 
the finest wine sitting on a table. To Bill's delight, he sees a PC in the corner. Without 
hesitation, Bill says "I'll take this option."

"Fine," says Satan, allowing Bill to enter the room. Satan locks the room after Bill.

As he turns around, he bumps into Lucifer. "That was Bill Gates!" cried Lucifer. "Why did you
 give him the best place of all!"

"That's what everyone thinks" snickered Satan.

"The bottle has a hole in it!"

"What about the PC?"

"It's got Windows 95!" laughed Satan.

"And it's missing three keys,"

"Which three?"

"Control, Alt and Delete."
