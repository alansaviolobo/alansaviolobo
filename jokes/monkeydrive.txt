What were you doin?

A police officer came upon a terrible wreck
where the driver and passenger had been killed.

As the officer examined the wreckage, a small
monkey came out of the brush and hopped around
the crashed car.

The officer glanced down at the money and said, “I
wish you could talk.”

The monkey shook his head up and down.

“You can understand what I’m saying?” asked the
astounded officer.

Again, the monkey shook his head up and down.

“Well, did you see this accident?”

“Yes,” motioned the monkey.

“What happened?”

The monkey pretended to have a can in his hand
and turned it up by his mouth.

“They were drinking?” asked the officer.

“Yes.”

“What else?”

The monkey pinched his fingers together and held
them by his mouth.

“They were doing drugs?”

“Yes.”

“Now, just wait a minute. You’re saying that they
were drinking and doing drugs just before the car
got wrecked?”

“Yes.”

“What were you doing during all of this time?”

“Driving,” motioned the monkey.
