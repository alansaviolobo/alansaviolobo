Mom's Affair

A woman takes a lover during the day, while her husband is at work. One day, her 9-year-old 
son hides in the closet during one of her romps. Her husband comes home unexpectedly, so she 
hides the lover in the closet. 
The little boy says, "It's dark in here." 
The man whispers, "Yes, it is." 
Boy - "I have a baseball." 
Man - "That's nice." 
Boy - "Want to buy it?" 
Man - "No, thanks." 
Boy - "My dad's outside." 
Man - "OK, how much?" 
Boy - "$250." 


In the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the mom's lover end up in the closet 
together. 
Boy - "It's dark in here." 
Man - "Yes, it is." 
Boy - "I have a baseball glove." 
Man - Remembering last time, asks, "How much?" 
Boy - "$750." 
Man - "Fine." 


A few days later, the father says to the boy, "Grab your ball and glove. Let's go outside and 
toss the baseball." 
The boy says, "I can't. I sold them." 
The father asks, "How much did you sell them for?" 
The son says "$1,000." 
The father says, "It's terrible to overcharge your friends like that. That's way more than 
those two things cost. I'm going to take you to church and make you confess." 
They go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth and he 
closes the door. 
The boy says, "It's dark in here." 
The priest says, "Don't start that shit again!"
