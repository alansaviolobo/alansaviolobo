An Order of Spaghetti

A doctor was having an affair with his nurse. Shortly afterward, she told him she was 
pregnant. Not wanting his wife to know, he gave the nurse a sum of money and asked her 
to go to Italy and have the baby there.
"But how will I let you know the baby is born?" she asked.
He replied, "Just send me a postcard and write 'spaghetti' on the back. I'll take care of 
expenses."
Not knowing what else to do, the nurse took the money and flew to Italy.
Six months went by and then one day the doctor's wife called him at the office and 
explained, "Dear, you received a very strange postcard in the mail today from Europe, and 
I don't understand what it means."
The doctor said, "Just wait until I get home and I will explain it to you." Later that 
evening, the doctor came home, read the postcard, fell to the floor with a heart attack. 
Paramedics rushed him to the ER. The lead medic stayed back to comfort the wife. He asked 
what trauma had precipitated the cardiac arrest. So the wife picked up the card and read, 
"Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti - Two with sausage and meatballs, two without."
