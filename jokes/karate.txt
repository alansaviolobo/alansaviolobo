"The Karate Dog"

Harold's new job had him working really late. He decides to get his wife a watchdog. He 
goes to the pet store and asks for a doberman. 
The employee said, "If its a guard dog you want I have a dog just for you." The man walks 
to the back of the store to get a dog and comes back with a little poodle. 
Harold says, "This small thing, a watch dog? You're kidding,right?" 
The employee says, "No, this dog is special; he knows karate."
"Karate? I don't believe it," Harold says.
The employee puts the dog down and says, "Karate the sign." 
And he points to a sign advertising dog food. The dog runs up and rips the sign to shreds. 
Harold is amazed at this.
The employee then says, "Karate the chair." And he points to a chair in the corner. 
The dog runs up and rips the chair to shreds. By now Harold is convinced.
"I'll take him," he says.
When he gets home he surprises his wife and she yells out, "This 
little thing, a watch dog? No way." 
Harold says, "But this dog knows karate."
"Karate," she yells. "Karate my ass!"
