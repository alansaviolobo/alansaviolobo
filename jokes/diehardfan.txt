DieHard Fan

A Yankee fan was enjoying himself at the game in a packed Yankee Stadium, until he noticed an
empty seat down in front. He went down and asked the guy next to it if he knew whose seat it 
was. 
The guy said, "Yes, that's my wife's seat. We have never missed a game since Joe DiMaggio 
played, but now my wife is dead." 
The fan offered his sympathy and said it was really too bad that he couldn't find some 
relative to enjoy the game with. 
"Oh no - I can." the guy replied. "It's just that they're all at the funeral."
