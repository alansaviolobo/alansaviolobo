SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING

IN ORDER TO ASSURE THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF QUALITY WORK AND PRODUCTIVITY FROM EMPLOYEES, 
IT WILL BE OUR POLICY TO KEEP ALL EMPLOYEES WELL TRAINED THROUGH OUR PROGRAM OF 
SPECIAL  HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING (S.H.I.T.). 
WE ARE TRYING TO GIVE EMPLOYEES MORE S.H.I.T. THAN ANYONE ELSE. 
IF YOU FEEL THAT YOU DO NOT RECEIVE YOUR SHARE OF S.H.I.T. ON THE JOB, 
PLEASE SEE YOUR MANAGER. YOU WILL BE IMMEDIATELY PLACED AT THE TOP OF THE S.H.I.T. LIST, 
AND OUR MANAGERS ARE ESPECIALLY SKILLED AT SEEING THAT YOU GET ALL THE S.H.I.T. YOU CAN HANDLE. 
EMPLOYEES WHO DON`T TAKE THEIR S.H.I.T. WILL BE PLACED IN 
DEPARTMENTAL EMPLOYEE EVALUATION PROGRAMS (D.E.E.P S.H.I.T.). 
THOSE WHO FAIL TO TAKE D.E.E.P S.H.I.T. SERIOUSLY WILL HAVE TO GO  TO 
EMPLOYEE ATTITUDE TRAINING (E.A.T S.H.I.T.). 
SINCE OUR MANAGERS TOOK S.H.I.T. BEFORE THEY WERE PROMOTED, THEY DON`T
HAVE TO DO S.H.I.T. ANYMORE, AND ARE ALL FULL OF S.H.I.T. ALREADY.
IF YOU ARE FULL OF S.H.I.T., YOU MAY BE INTERESTED IN A JOB  TRAINING
OTHERS. WE CAN ADD YOUR NAME TO OUR 
BASIC UNDERSTANDING LECTURE LIST (B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T.).
THOSE WHO ARE FULL OF B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T. WILL GET THE S.H.I.T. JOBS, 
AND CAN APPLY FOR PROMOTION TO 
DIRECTOR OF INTENSITY PROGRAMMING (D.I.P.S.H.I.T.). 
IF YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS, PLEASE DIRECT THEM TO OUR 
HEAD OF TRAINING, SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING (H.O.T. S.H.I.T.). 

THANK YOU,
BOSS IN GENERAL SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING (B.I.G. S.H.I.T.)
