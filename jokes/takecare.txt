TAKE CARE

Driving in a fog, a motorist followed the tail light ahead of him. Suddenly, the car ahead of 
him stopped and he crashed into the rear bumper.
"why don't you signal when you are going to stop?" he shouted angrily to the man ahead.
"why should i?"  came the reply, "i'm in my own garage."
