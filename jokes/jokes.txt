golf club after a round, showering and getting changed
for the 19th hole. Suddenly a mobile phone on one of the benches
rings. One of the men picks it up, and the following conversation
ensues:
(H - Husband, W - Wife)

H - "Hello?"
W - "Honey, it's me. Are you at the club?"
H - "Yes."
W - "Great! I am at the mall two blocks from where you
are. I just saw a beautiful leather coat. 
It's absolutely gorgeous!! Can I buy it?"
H - "What's the price?"
W - "Only $1,000."
H - "Well, OK, go ahead and get it, if you like it
that much..."
W - "Ahhh, and I also stopped by the Mercedes
dealership and saw the 2002 models.
I saw one I really liked. I spoke with
the salesman, and he gave me a really good price .. 
and since we need to exchange the BMW that we 
bought last year...
H - "What price did he quote you?"
W - "Only $60,000..."
H - "OK, but for that price I want it with all the
options."
W - "Great! But before we hang up, something else..."
H - "What?"
W - "It might look like a lot, but I was reconciling
your bank account and I stopped by the real estate
agent this morning and saw the house
we had looked at last year.
It's for sale!! Remember?
The one with a pool English garden, acre
of park area, beachfront property."
H - "How much are they asking?"
W - "Only $450,000 -- a magnificent price...and I see
that we have that much in the bank to cover..."
H - "Well, then go ahead and buy it, but just bid up
to $420,000. OK?"
W - "OK, sweetie...Thanks! I'll see you later!! I love
you!!!"
H - "Bye...I love you too..."

The man hangs up & closes the phone's flap. The other
men are looking at him in astonishment and derision. The
husband raises his hand while holding the phone and asks
"Does anyone know who this Cell phone belongs to???"  

******************************************************************* 
At a convention of blondes, a speaker insisted that the 

“dumb blonde” myth is all wrong. 

To prove it he asked one cute young volunteer, 

“How much is 101 plus 20?”

The blonde answered, “120.”

“No,” he said, “that’s not right.”

The audience called out, “Give her another chance.”

So the speaker asked the blonde, “How much is 10 plus 13?”

Slowly the blonde replied, “16.”

“Sorry,” he said, shaking his head.

Once again the crowd roared,

“Give her another chance.”

“This is your last try,” warned the speaker. “How much is 2 plus 2?”

Carefully she ventured, “Four?”

And the crowd yelled, “Give her another chance!”
