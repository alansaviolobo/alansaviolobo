When Mozart passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days
later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some 
strange noise coming from the area where Mozart was buried. Terrified,
the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it.The priest 
bent close to the grave and heard some faint,unrecognizable music
coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town 
magistrate.When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave,
listened for a moment, and said, "Ah, yes, that's Mozart's Ninth 
Symphony,being played backwards."He listened a while longer, and said,
"There's the Eighth Symphony,and it's backwards, too. 
Most puzzling." So the magistrate kept listening; 
"There's the Seventh... 
the Sixth...
the Fifth..."

Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate;
he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery,
"My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Mozart decomposing."
