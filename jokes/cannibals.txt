Cannibals

Two hungry cannibals are walking through the forest when they see a man who had recently passed
away. One cannibal says, "Look at this! You start at the feet and I'll start at the head and 
we'll meet in the middle." So the two cannibals start eating. 
After a half an hour one stops eating, looks up and says, "I don't know about you, but this is 
great! How are you doing?" 
The other cannibal answers, "This is great! I'm havin' a ball!" 
The other cannibal says, "Hey, slow down, you're eating too fast!"
