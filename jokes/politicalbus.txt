Country Politics

A busload of politicians were driving down a country road, when suddenly the bus ran off the 
road and crashed into an old farmer's barn. 
The old farmer got off his tractor and went to investigate. Soon he dug a hole and buried the 
politicians. A few days later, the local sheriff came out, saw the crashed bus and asked the 
old farmer where all the politicians had gone. 
The old farmer told him he had buried them. 
The sheriff asked the old farmer, "Lordy, were they ALL dead?" 
The old farmer said, "Well, some of them said they weren't, but you know how them crooked 
politicians lie."
