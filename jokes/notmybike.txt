Give a Guy a Break!

I went to the store the other day. I was only in
there for about 5 minutes, and when I came out, there
was a stinkin' motorcycle cop writing a parking ticket.

So I went up to him and said, "Come on buddy,
how about giving a guy a break?"

He ignored me and continued writing the ticket.

So I called him a pencil necked nazi. He glared at me
and started writing another ticket for having bald tires!!

So I called him a good-for-nothing moron. He finished
the second ticket and put it on the bike with the first.

Then he started writing a third ticket!!

This went on for about 20 minutes. The more I abused
him, the more tickets he wrote.

I didn't really care.

My car was parked around the corner!
