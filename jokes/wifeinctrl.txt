
Is the wife in control?

Everybody on earth dies and goes to heaven. God comes and says "I want the men to make two lines. One line for the men 
that dominated their women on earth and the other line for the men that were whipped by their women. Also, I want all the 
women to go with St Peter." 

Said and done, the next time God looks the women are gone and there are two lines. The line of the men that were whipped
was 100 miles long, on the line of men that dominated women there was only one man. 

God got mad and said. "You men should be ashamed of yourselves. I created you in my image, and you were all whipped 
by your mates. Look at the only one of my sons that stood up and made me proud, Learn from him!" 
"Tell them my son how did you manage to be the only one on that line?"
the man said, "I don't know. My wife told me to stand here."
