Who Runs the Human Body?

In the human body, which organ is in charge?
All the organs of the body were having a meeting, trying to decide who was in charge.
The brain said: "I should be in charge, because I run all the body's systems, so without me
nothing would happen."
"I should be in charge," said the heart, "because I pump the blood and circulate oxygen all
over the body, so without me you'd all waste away."
"I should be in charge," said the stomach, "because I process food and give all of you energy."
"I should be in charge," said the rectum, "because I'm responsible for waste removal."
All the other body parts laughed at the rectum and insulted him, so in a huff, he shut down 
tight. Within a few days, the brain had a terrible headache, the stomach was bloated, and the 
blood was toxic. Eventually the other organs gave in. They all agreed that the rectum should be
the boss.
The moral of the story? 
You don't have to be smart or important to be in charge... just an asshole.
