Dragging Their Feet  

Two men are approaching each other on a sidewalk. Both are dragging their right foot as they 
walk.As they meet, one man looks at the other knowingly, points to his foot and says, 
Vietnam, 1969." 
The other points his thumb behind him and says, "Dog crap, 20 feet back."
